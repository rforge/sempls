* Design
  - semspec -> semrepr -> model.frame (-> semfit)

** semspec
   - Is a list of raw R formulas describing the model; specified by
     the user with latent(formula), regression(formula), etc. combined
     by the '+'.
   - How to remove a part from a model?
     - Define '-' and assign each part a unique number which is seen
       in the print-output?

** semrepr
   - The internal representation of the model.
   - Function parse_semspec() creates this representation.
   - If a developer wants to extend the syntax with unknown
     functionality, this function has to be extendend (i.e.,
     overwritten).

** model.frame
   - Following the common R manner, a function model.frame takes the
     semspec and the data and returns the matrix representation
     - Should it be actually model.matrix?

** semfit
   - For demonstration purpose we write some fit-methods to show that
     the syntax can be easily used with the available packages.
   - The goal is, however, that the package developers import semspec.

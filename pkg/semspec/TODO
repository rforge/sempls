* Design idea
  - semspec -> semrepr -> model.matrix (-> semfit)

** semspec
   - Is a list of raw R formulas describing the model; specified by
     the user with latent(formula), regression(formula), etc. combined
     by the '+'.
   - How to remove a part from a model?
     - Define '-' and assign each part a unique number which is seen
       in the print-output?
     - Implement an ~update~ function?

** semrepr
   - The internal representation of the model.
   - Function parse_semspec() creates this representation.
   - If a developer wants to extend the syntax with unknown
     functionality, this function has to be extendend (i.e.,
     overwritten).

** model.matrix
   - Following the common R manner, a function model.frame takes the
     semspec and the data and returns the matrix representation
     - Should it be actually model.matrix? *Yes*

** semfit
   - For demonstration purpose we write some fit-methods to show that
     the syntax can be easily used with the available packages.
   - The goal is, however, that the package developers import semspec.


* Semantic
  - ~regression~ and ~latent~ formulae define the edges of a graph
    - Do ~intercept~ and ~covariance~ define edges as well?
      - ~variance~ is a loop? *Yes*
      - ~covariance~ is an edges between the variables? *Yes*
      - ~intercept~ is a edge between a constant variable and the
        defined variable? *Yes*
	- Similar to neural networks?

  - A ~group~ defines multiple edges, i.e., as many edges as there are
    levels; this is now a multigraph.

  - The edges represent the parameters to estimate.
    - Each parameter has a ~name~ and a ~start~ value
      - What are their default values?
        - A concatenation of the formula name, the group name, and the
          parameter name creates a unique parameter name

  - ~constraint~ formulae define constraints on the parameters; i.e.,
    edge attributes.


* Representation
  1. An ~edgelist~ to collect all edges
     - An edge has attributes
       - the ~name~ and the ~start~ value
       - the ~group~

  2. Something to represent a ~constraint~
     - Phantom variables, see "Using phantom and imaginary latent
       variables to parameterize constraints in linear structural
       models" by David Rindskopf (Psychometrika, 1984)
       - via http://davidakenny.net/cm/constr.htm

* Fitting
  - As this is a multigraph, this can be seen as a flow network
    - Can the parameter estimation seen as a /constraint flow
      optimization problem/
      - If yes, is there a benefit?
	- Is this a non-parametric fitting method?
    - How to define the flow? What is the source and what is the sink?
      - Sources are the manifest variables
      - An artificial sink is created from all latent variables
      - The flow of the errors according to a user-defined error
        function is minimized.
	- If the quadratic error is used, the same result as with PLS
          fitting should be computed (according to Armin)
	- The benefit ist, that an arbitrary error function can be
          defined without having to change to estimating function.
	  - absolut error, wheighted error, etc.
    - Constraints can be handled using the /Phantom variables/ approach

  - Isn't it more similar to neural networks and backpropagation?

** TODO semflow
   - Evaluate the sensuousness of the "Flowing SEMs" idea after the
     workshop
     - Should be doable---if we create a sound representation of the
       hypergraph in this project, we can use flow optimization
       algorithms available in the igraph package

* Design idea
  - semspec -> semrepr -> model.matrix (-> semfit)

** semspec
   - Is a list of raw R formulas describing the model; specified by
     the user with latent(formula), regression(formula), etc. combined
     by the '+'.
   - How to remove a part from a model?
     - Define '-' and assign each part a unique number which is seen
       in the print-output?
     - Implement an ~update~ function?

** semrepr
   - The internal representation of the model.
   - Function parse_semspec() creates this representation.
   - If a developer wants to extend the syntax with unknown
     functionality, this function has to be extendend (i.e.,
     overwritten).

** model.matrix
   - Following the common R manner, a function model.frame takes the
     semspec and the data and returns the matrix representation
     - Should it be actually model.matrix? *Yes*

** semfit
   - For demonstration purpose we write some fit-methods to show that
     the syntax can be easily used with the available packages.
   - The goal is, however, that the package developers import semspec.


* Semantic
  - ~regression~ and ~latent~ formulae define the edges of a graph
    - Do ~intercept~ and ~covariance~ define edges as well?

  - A ~group~ defines multiple edges, i.e., as many edges as there are
    levels; this is now a multigraph.

  - The edges represent the parameters to estimate.
    - Each parameter has a ~name~ and a ~start~ value
      - What are their default values?
        - A concatenation of hte formula name, the group name, and the
          parameter name creates a unique parameter name

  - ~constraint~ formulae define constraints on the parameters; i.e.,
    edge attributes.

* Representation
  - semrepr is an /edgelist/
